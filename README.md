# Ideation

> Design ideas that appeal to me and __may__ be a source of insperation

- [JJWKB **Derivative** R1](https://jjwkb.com/pages/derivative-r1)
  - The anno color!
    - <img src="docs/assets/img/color-468.svg" width="96" height="96" alt="#468"> - *a.k.a.* HTML color #468 - close to "Pantone / PMS 2186 UP" <img src="https://encycolorpedia.com/486785.svg" width="96" height="96" alt="Pantone / PMS 2186 UP">
  - Bottom of KB, namely:
    - the rounding towards the back (chamfer/bevel), and gap for fingers/lifting along the edges
    - the weight's milled-in inset
  - Top of KB, namely:
    - the edging on the front lip

- [Connon Keys + `ai03` **Brutal V2**](https://cannonkeys.com/products/brutal-v2-1800-keyboard)
  - The way the top case is different color to the bottom
    - make bottom in all copper ?!
  - The way it hides the top-to-bottom seam with the 45' chamfer/bevel on the bottom edge of the top case

- Gadget System
  - On plate *(as apposed to PCB)*
  - Use [**GEON Works** Tadpole's](https://geon.works/products/tadpole)
  - ... but also allow for socks and/or jackets, like the [QwertyKeys QK's](https://www.qwertykeys.com/products/qk65-parts-1?variant=42933732212979)
